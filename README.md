# CodeRefinery pre-workshop survey

Participants of CodeRefinery workshops are asked to fill a pre-workshop 
survey before attending the workshop. In this survey we collect information 
on previous experience with various tools and programming practices.

The survey includes among others the following questions:

- What is your gender? (used for reporting purposes)
- What operating system do you use?
- What is your programming experience? 
- Do you use version control?
- Do you use code review?
- Do you use automated testing?
- What is your preferred programming language?
- How do you document your code?
